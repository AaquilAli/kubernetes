Question: Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

My Answer:
  A Daemon set is used when we want exactly one instance of pod running in each node in the cluster.
	A Daemon Set wont allow pods of same type to run in a single pod.
	The reason of running a daemon set type of pod in each node are:
	1. Running a logs collection on every node.
	2. Monitoring daemon on every node.
	
	With the replica set we dont know if all the pods will run in every node but with daemon set we can do that
	and hence can monitior and logs the details of each pod in a different nodes.
